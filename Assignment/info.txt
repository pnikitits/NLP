The first 3 metrics are computed automatically with a python script.

Penalties will be applied for:
Deliverable delays (-1 point per day)
Group of more than 4: -5 pts per extra member, e.g. group of 6 => penalty = -5 x 2 = -10
Exec error due to the use of a non-allowed python library: -5 pts
Exec error due the use of a non compatible version of a library: -5 pts
Exec error due to non compatible deliverable format (zip) or folder structure: -2 pts
Other exec errors: penalty will depend on how much effort is required to correct the errors and make the program run successfully.

Submission deadline: April 5, 2024.

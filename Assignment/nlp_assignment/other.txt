Each line contains 5 tab-separated fields: the polarity of the opinion (the ground truth polarity label), the aspect category on which the opinion is expressed, a specific target term, the character offsets of the term (start:end), and the sentence in which the term occurs and the opinion is expressed.

example:
positive	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	seating	18:25	short and sweet â€“ seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.
positive	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	trattoria	25:34	This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.
positive	FOOD#QUALITY	food	98:102	The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
negative	SERVICE#GENERAL	STAFF	5:10	THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.

i have done:
X_train = df_train.iloc[:, 1:]
y_train = df_train.iloc[:, 0]
print(y_train.shape , X_train.shape)
(1502,) (1502, 4)

make a classifier that produces a polarity label: positive, negative or neutral. use pytorch and the gpu.
